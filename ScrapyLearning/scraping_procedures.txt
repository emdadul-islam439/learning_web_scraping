1) inside the "ScrapyLearning/quotetutorial/quotetutorial/spiders" or in one word- "spiders" folder-> 
    i) create a python file. [i've created it as 'quotes_spider.py']
    ii) import the scrapy [i've written 'import scrapy']
    iii) create a class [i've created the class as 'class QuoteTutorial(scrapy.spiders):']
        * create a variable 'name' [i've created it as 'name="quotes" ']
        * create a list named 'start_urls' [i've created it as "start_urls = ["https://quotes.toscrape.com/"]"]
        * create a function named 'parse(..., ....)' [i've created it as "def parse(self, response):"]
            -a 'yield' section is needed [i've written is as "yield {'titletext' : title}"]

2) for running the 'quotetutorial' file
    i) in the terminal write "scrapy crawl <name-of-the-spider/crawler>" [i've written "scrapy crawl quotes"]
    ii) many many lines of output will be shown inside the terminal. But, in the middle there will be some lines containing the output 
        I've found it very hard to find the outputs in the middle of so many lines.

3) Scrapping can be done into the SCRAPY SHELL
    i) write "scrapy shell '<url-of-the-link-you-want-to-scrap>'" in the terminal [i've written-> scrapy shell "https://quotes.toscrape.come/"]
    ii) After some lines i've seen a line containing ">>>". You can get output by written something in this line. 
        * i've written-> response.css('title::text').extract()]
        - the output was -> ['Quotes to Scrape']
        * for the command -> response.css('title').extract()
        - the out put was-> ['<title>Quotes to Scrape</title>']
        * for the command -> response.css('title')
        - the out put was-> [<Selector xpath='descendant-or-self::title' data='<title>Quotes to Scrape</title>'>]
        * i've written-> response.css('title::text')[0].extract() [exactly as "response.css('title::text')[0].extract_first()"]
        - the output was -> 'Quotes to Scrape'

    iii)
